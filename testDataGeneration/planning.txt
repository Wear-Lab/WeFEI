It appears that I will have to implement the getData method myself, so the file format doesn't actually matter as long as I can parse it

What I'm going to do is make the output an easy to parse string in CSV format:
accel.x,accel,y,accel.z,gyro.x,gyro.y,gyro.z

Measure sampling frequency over the course of the program and output that to the console - store somewhere outside the file for use when programing with scikinematics


Need to run a script to fix the really small numbers that are written with e and make them just .000000 if we have to



Fix: 
- running can't find module tkinter in scikinematics
- pygame still won't correctly install
- WARNING: pip is being invoked by an old script wrapper. This will fail in a future version of pip.
