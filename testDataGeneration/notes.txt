Must give a matrix [[],...] for the data of accel/omega

Next experiment: If I split the data in half, can I call get_data again with a dataset that is a continuation of the previous
and have the orientation be sustained between the two sets?

This would mean that I could throw a single frame (possibly skipping a fixed number in between if it's too much computation) 
in a matrix [[]] and have it calculate the current orientation, then manually call get_data with the next frame matrix

In that case, What does sensor.quat look like? Do we just always take the last list of that matrix?
