TODOS for week of 9/20
- Research what those gravity calculations are and if they're safe
    - Might also be able to ask Surendar or someone knowledgable
    - Could also just try it and see if it works
- Convert function inputs and outputs to a single value if possible, or an array with a single value if not
- Store orientation and frame data in the main class and recycle these values for each new frame to the function
