Make sure the following flags are set correct and any necessary 
installs (OPENCV and Cuda) are done (it'll tell you if they aren't)


GPU=1
CUDNN=0
CUDNN_HALF=0
OPENCV=1
AVX=0
OPENMP=0
LIBSO=1
ZED_CAMERA=0
ZED_CAMERA_v2_8=0

# set GPU=1 and CUDNN=1 to speedup on GPU
# set CUDNN_HALF=1 to further speedup 3 x times (Mixed-precision on Tensor Cores) GPU: Volta, Xavier, Turing and higher
# set AVX=1 and OPENMP=1 to speedup on CPU (if error occurs then set AVX=0)
# set ZED_CAMERA=1 to enable ZED SDK 3.0 and above
# set ZED_CAMERA_v2_8=1 to enable ZED SDK 2.X


Make sure the following lines are pointing at a valid path on your system 
(anything that starts with /usr/ or involves cuda, which may differ on each system)
