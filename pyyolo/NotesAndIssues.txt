NOTE: Must compile v4 to create libdarknet.so, which the following line links to
Run ./runYolo.sh or use the commands below consecutively:

export LIB_DARKNET=/home/wearlabucf/Desktop/WeFEI/YOLOv4/libdarknet.so
python3 test.py


export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/pyrealsense2
python depthTest.py


RealSense frames: Set as 1280 x 720 px
PyYOLO frames are 1920 width by 1080 height (px)

rs2_deproject_pixel_to_point(...)	

Given pixel coordinates and depth in an image with no distortion or inverse distortion coefficients, compute the corresponding point in 3D space relative to the same camera
positive x is to the right of the camera, positive y is below the camera, positive z is in front of the camera

First rotation with φ about yaw axis (phi)
Second rotation with theta is pitch about new y axis
Final rotation is angle ψ about newest x axis (psi)


CURRENT TODOS:
- Drift is SO BAD that acceleration calculations aren't correct even after a few movements of the camera (currently testing 9.81 in the y direction of inertial frame, body frame starts correct but fucks itself up real bad real quick)
- Seems like the angles don't properly match up with axis or something, since y and z axis on resultant vectors should be swapped
